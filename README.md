# First Node Application!

## Initialising a new Node.js Project

`npm init` initialises a new Node.js project by creating a `package.json` file. The file serves as a configuration file for the project and contains important information such as project name, version, entry point, dependencies and scripts. 

Next, we create an "index.js" file to store the source code. 

## Using Express.js as the web application framework

`npm install express` will download and install the `express` package along with its dependencies in the Node.js project. 

## Running the Node.js app

`node index.js` runs the Node.js application with the `index.js` file as the entry point. When you run `node index.js`, Node.js executes the JavaScript code in the `index.js` file.
